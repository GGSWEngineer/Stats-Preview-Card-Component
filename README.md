## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to be careful with the use of min-height, min-width, max-width, max-height especially when adding media queries. I'll ask myself questions like, "why isn't the img taking up the full height?" and that is because I have a max-height: 240px in the original part of the css file (not in the media queries). 

Also, I have to be careful with mix-blend-mode.

Accoding to chatGPT, "mix-blend-mode can be resource-intensive, especially if used extensively. Use it judiciously, and be aware of its potential impact on performance."
